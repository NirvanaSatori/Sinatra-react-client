The focus of this project is building a Sinatra API backend that uses Active Record to access and persist data in a database, which will be used by a separate React frontend that interacts with the database via the API.
Requirements

For this project, you must:

    Use Active Record to interact with a database.
    Have a minimum of two models with a one-to-many relationship.
    Create API routes in Sinatra that handles at least three different CRUD actions for at least one of your Active Record models.
    Build a separate React frontend application that interacts with the API to perform CRUD actions.
    Use good OO design patterns. You should have separate classes for each of your models, and create instance and class methods as necessary.

For example, build a gift list application with a React frontend interface and a Sinatra backend API, where a user can:

    Create a new gift
    Read a list of all gifts
    Update an individual gift
    Delete a gift
